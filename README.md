# Perceptron with GUI
In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. 
## Purpose
A program which can classify two sets of data.＜/br＞
User choose a file from the dataset, and then enter a learning rate and a iteration time.＜/br＞
At last, user click on train or test button to see the result of classification.
